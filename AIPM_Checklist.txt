
Data??

Structured Data -> Machine Learning Algorithms

Unstructured-> Computer Vision with deep learning(Images+Videos),
               
               Natural Language Processing with Deeplearning(Text,Audio)

Types of Analytics:

1) Descriptive Analytics-What happened in the past?

2) Diagnostic Analytics->Why did it happen?

3) Predictive Analytics- What may happen in the Future?

4) Prescriptive Analytics-What actions/Solutions to be taken?

ML/AI/DS/Analytics

1) Business Understanding/Problem Statement/Usecase Identification-> AIPM

AIPM should give detailed description/report about the usecase


2) Analytic Approach ->ML/CV/NLP ->DS (AIPM help may/may not be required)

Supervised Learning->Labelled data(Column for Dependent Variable)

Dependent variable->numerical(Regression)

->Linear Regression

->KNN Regression

->Support Vector Machine Regression(SVM)

->Decision Tree Regression

->Bagging

->AdaBoost

->Gradient Boost

->XG Boost

->Random Forest

Categorical(Classification)

-> Logistic Regression

-> KNN Classifier

->SVM Classifier

->Decision Tree Classifier

->Bagging Classifier

->AdaBoost Classifier

->gradient Boost

->Random Forest

->Naive Bayes Classifier



KNN  -> 85%   84%

Random Forest -> 85%   84%

3)Data Requirements/Data Collection-> AIPM and DS and DE

Description of the data and the challenges(quality) with/of the dataset

4)Data Understanding->Data Visualization (Data Scientist)

Suggestion-> Discuss with DS and get the inferences.

Ask them to give the detailed inferences

AIPM->More questionnaire

5) Data Preparation (Data Scientists)

DS->Missing values, Outliers(optional),Redundancy(Duplicacy),Categorical data handling

Skewness in the data?

Data is Balanced?(Imbalance ->Class distribution skewness)

Imbalanced-> Which approach?

Fraudulent Transaction->less than 1%   non fraudulent (99%)->Model biased towards non fraud

Churn     70%(700)     Not a churn  -30%(300)

  upsample-   Churn -700   Not a churn(700 by duplicating the records)
  Downsampling- Churn- 300(sample of 300 from 700)   Not a churn -300
  Random sampling-Churn- 200      Not a churn-200
  SMOTE- Churn -700      Not a churn -700(300+400 neighboring data points)

6)Modelling and Evaluation:(DS) (AIPM can interfere)

AIPM-> Atleast 5 algorithms to be implemented

Top 3 algorithms

Finally we can end up with one (Highest score)(No underfitting  no overfitting),(Complexity of the model),(FP,FN)

underfitting-> Train and Test less than 75%

Overfitting-> Train and Test score difference should be less than 5%(The score should be >75%)

7)Deployment

Prior to deployment(DS to deploy it locally(ex:gradio) ->Performance of the model

Suggestion: Data to DS (90%)

Remaining 10%,u can check the performance of the Model

DS ->90% score

85%

Deviation -> (Tweak the Hyperparameter)

Churn         churn


Not a Churn   Churn


Churn           Churn

Churn       Not
 
Not a churn    Not


80        78

56      58

58      49

69      68


AIPM-> Continuous Monitoring

If any deviation,Discuss with DS and adjust the model(Tweak)
